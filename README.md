#TechnicalTask
This is a repo to demonstrate my scripting and configuration management ability.

I have put this together in one evening using Windows Server as the OS, PowerShell as a scripting language and Ansible as the configuration management tool. I would look to use something like Jenkins to schedule test and live pipelines and look to expand on my Ansible playbook with roles and ansible-vault. There were also a few other choices I could have made:

- Active Directory User instead of a local user and group
- I could have used the pester module to deliver the pester test I wrote

Hopefully this is enough to show that I know what I am doing and I look forward to your feedback. :)
